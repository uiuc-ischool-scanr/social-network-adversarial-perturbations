# Graph Simulation Framework

An open-source framework to assess the robustness of network structures and metrics to adversarial attacks and ascertain adversarial attack patterns.

##### Development Goal

Our ultimate goal is to create a framework that can support any graph configurations, simulations, and be the test-bed for finding changes and optimal results of various changes that can be modeled in the form of a network.

## More Background

Almost any information problem can be postulated as a network with nodes and relations. For instance, a simple food supply chain may involve the agricultural farms which create the goods, which are then transported to suppliers, followed by wholesalers, supermarkets, and finally, the curated food gets to consumers. In this example, each of these entities can be a node in the network, and their connection can be an edge. By the same token, a plethora of other real-world scenarios can be modeled as networks. Other examples that come to mind are hyperlink networks that are used to assess the raking of a given Google search or even a Tweet chain that can express how misinformation is spreading on social media.

Unfortunately, most of these networks can be attacked and undermined by bad actors (adversaries) which can aim to change the flow of information or perception of influence in those real-world situations (adversarial attacks) for their own benefit.

Our open-source Python framework provides a way to simulate such networks, adversaries, and adversarial attacks for any domain, and find patterns in how robust the networks are to these attacks, as well as the patterns that adversaries can employ to yield their goals.

We believe that by understanding the robustness of networks to adversarial attacks, as well as the patterns of those attacks, can better enable society to mitigate or even eliminate such attacks in the future.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed on your machine.

## Configuring the Framework/Experiments

#### Installation
1. Copy or clone this repository to your local machine e.g. `git clone https://github.com/uiuc-ischool-scanr/social-network-adversarial-perturbations`
1. Install Python (version 3 or greater) and pip on your Machine if you haven't already. To check that they are installed run `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal and ensure they return a proper version.
1. Install Jupyter Notebook.
1. Install all requirements and dependencies of this framework by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root repository location (e.g. `adversarial-learning-social-graphs` folder).

#### Input-Graph Generation

This tool can either use external `.edgelist` type graphs to be imported in the configuration files, or we can generate synthetic graphs ourselves. In order to generate them, we do the following:

1. Check the `/graph-generator/generate_sample_graphs.py` script which you can pick what parameters you want to generate the graphs with, what types of graphs to generate, and how many graphs to generate. This script uses [NetworkX Graph Generators](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-2.0/reference/generators.html) which provides documentation for how these generators work.
1. Feel free to tweak the parameters of `generate_sample_graphs.py` for your type of experiments/graphs.
1. Execute `python generate_sample_graphs.py` to generate the graphs in the `created_graphs_output` folder.

#### Input-Config Generation

The framework uses configuration files to run the experiments/simulations. In order to generate such files (so that we don't have to do it manually), we can generate bulk/batch configuration files to run experiments in batch. For more information on the details of a configuration and how that fits in with the framework/experiment, check out `Anatomy of a Configuration File` below. We generate configurations in bulk by doing the following:

1. Investigate `experiment-config-creator/creator-main.py` for how the configurations can be generated in batch. Note that this script generates many configuration files and many folders in the `output-experiments` location. This is done with the idea that one configuration file is one "type" of experiment with name `exp1` (name of config file as well with `.json` at the end), which then should generate all output results into the `output-experiments/exp1` folder.
1. Feel free to tweak the parameters of `creator-main.py` for your type of experiments.
1. Execute `python creator-main.py` which should generate all configuration files in the `input-configs` folder, and all respective output experiment folders in the `output-experiment` folder.

## Running the Framework
- Simply execute `python advlearningsocgraph_main.py` from the main folder.
- After the script completes, the results should be present under `/output-experiments/<exp-folder(s)>/`.

## Visualizing Results
1. Browse to the `adversarial-learning-social-graphs/result-analyzers/` path.
1. Run the command `jupyter notebook`.
1. Go to `http://localhost:8888/` in your browser as directed by the command line if it did not direct you there already.
1. To evaluate a single experiment, launch the `InterpretSingleExperiment.ipynb` and change the `folder_path` variable to contain the folder where the output `.json` file lies. Then change the `file_name` variable to the name of the file you would like to inspect e.g. `file_name = 'adv_learning_results_increase_betweenness_centrality_graphtype_from_file_budget_1_bootstrapsample_0_tier_0_subsample_0.json'`. Run this jupyter notebook to visualize results for that specific experiment.
1. To evaluate a whole experiment set (where the results of an experiment set should all be included in the same folder), launch the `InterpretAggregateExperimentSet.ipynb` and change the `final_experiment_output_path` to the folder of the experiment present in `output-experiments`. After running the whole notebook it should generate a plot of all optimal moves for that experiment set.
1. To generate many experiment sets in bulk, launch the `InterpretManyAggregateExperimentSets.ipynb` and execute all scripts from the notebook in order. This should look into all experiments/folders under `output-experiments` and generate the plots for each experiment type in `output-plots`. One can then look into each plot in `output-plots` and look for patterns/results.
1. Execute these scripts according to the Jupyter Notebook [documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation).

## How do all the Components Work Together (Pipeline)

Everything starts from the main `advlearnsocgraph_main.py` file which, when execuded, first grabs each configuration file from `input-configs` one by one, then for each config, configures the parameters of the simulation/experiment from that given config, including iterating through all the plots that config may point to. For instnace, if a config points to all X sampled graphs of type `random`, then each config will have X experiments for each particular graph. Then, the framework uses helpful functions/constants from `adfunc/adfunc.py` to configure the framework and run the experiments. During the experimentation process, the framework first finds all possible moves given the configurations, then it finds the optimal move given the defined configuration/criteria. Once one experiment is done, an output `.json` file is written to the presecribed `output-path` of the config at hand. This output file contains all configurations, pre-evaluation metrics/graphs and post-evaluation metrics/graphs as well as all tries for the experiment in detail in case further analysis needs to be done. Note that each experiment and therefore `.json` file is generated for each graph and each config. For example, if there are 10 configuration files in `input-configs` and each point to 10 graphs respectively, there should be 100 total output `.json` files in 10 respective folders where the folder name is the name of the config, all present in `output-experiments`.
